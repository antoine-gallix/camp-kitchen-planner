# INSTRUCTIONS
The thing here is to prepare and preset the ingredients separately so that people can
assemble their own buddha bowl.

## Prepare warm ingredients
1. Cut sweet potatoes to 1cm slices. Heat a pan with a tbsp of olive oil and cook for 5
minutes each side, until ready to eat.
2. Cut broccoli to bite size pieces and sauté until prepared (but crispy and not mushy).
3. Drain and squeeze the tofu as much as you can. Cut into small squares and fry with
olive and sesame oil until golden. Add the soy sauce and stir until absorbed.
4. Prepare quinoa: ratio of 1 cup quinoa to 1.25 cups water, cook 20 minutes.
5. In a mixing bowl toss the drained chickpeas with seasonings.
6. Heat a skillet, add 1 Tbsp oil and the drained chickpeas and sauté, stirring frequently
about 10 minutes until browned and fragrant. If they’re browning too quickly, turn
down heat. If there isn’t much browning going on, increase heat.

## Prepare cold ingredients
Chop cold ingredients (don’t mix them): Shred cabbage, slice carrots, cucumbers, green onion
into thin slices. Wash the arugula leaves.

## Prepare each dressing
mix all ingredients until smooth and pourable.
