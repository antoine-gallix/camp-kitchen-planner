Cook the brown rice: usually 1 cup rice to 2.25 cups water, 1 tsp oil and 0.5 tsp salt. Simmer for 45 minutes.
Heat canola oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add minced onion and cook until beginning to soften.
Mince and add ginger, garlic and cilantro stems and saut√© until tender, about 5 minutes. Watch out not to burn the garlic.
Stir in curry paste and cook 2 minutes. Slowly pour in coconut cream and milk, scraping up any curry paste with a wooden spoon.
Add tofu, cauliflower florets, mushrooms and tomatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 10 minutes until vegetables are just tender.
Add the spinach by the handful and stir after each addition until wilted.
