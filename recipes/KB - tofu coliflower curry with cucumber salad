# Instructions
Start cooking rice in 1 or 2 pots. ratio 1 cup rice to 2.5 cups water, 1 tsp oil and 0.5 tsp salt.
Bring water to boil, add rice, reduce heat and simmer about 45 minutes until ready.

## Curry
1. Heat canola oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add onion and cook until
beginning to soften.
2. Mince and add ginger, garlic and cilantro stems and sauté until tender, about 5
minutes. Watch out not to burn the garlic.
3. Stir in the curry paste and cook 2 minutes. Slowly pour in coconut cream and milk,
scraping up any curry paste with a wooden spoon.
4. Add tofu, cauliflower florets, mushrooms and tomatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to
medium-low and simmer for about 10 minutes until vegetables are just tender.
5. Add the spinach by the handful and stir after each addition until wilted.

## Salad
1. Cut onion to fine half rings. Mix them in a small bowl with the vinegar, sumac and 1⁄4
tsp salt and set aside, covered. Shake occasionally until the onions are soft.
2. Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise and quarter them. Scrape out the seeds with a
tablespoon and discard. Cut them into 2cm pieces. If you feel like a masterchef: Mix the
pieces in a bowl with about 1⁄2 tsp salt and leave to steep in water for about 20 minutes. Stir
frequently and discard the cucumber water at the end.
3. Finely slice the radishes, roughly chop the herbs and add to the cucumbers.
4. Wash the lemon in hot water and add about 1 tsp of lemon zest to the salad.
7. Dressing: minced garlic, 3 tbsp lemon juice, olive oil.
8. Fold the dressing into the cucumber salad and add the soaked sumac onions. Season
with ground black pepper.
