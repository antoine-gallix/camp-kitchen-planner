How to:
1. Boil water at a 1 cup water / 1 cup couscous ratio and pour the boiling water over the
couscous in a large container. Cover the container so that the couscous can cook and
absorb the water. After 15 minutes, mix in the 400 ml of olive oil. Add a bit of cumin, salt and
pepper. Mix and cover again for another 5 minutes.
2. Strain (and if necessary rinse) the chickpeas. Dice the onion and chop the garlic. Dice the
red beet into roughly d6-sized pieces. Chop the parsley and dill. Mix in a large container.
Juice the lemons and mix in with the the rape seed oil, salt, pepper, cumin and some of the
chili flakes.
3. Mix the yogurt sauce in a separate container with the soy yogurt, the rest of the olive oil,
sumach, Zaâ€™atar, roughly chopped mint, and chili flakes. Salt and pepper generously to taste.
Serve in 3 separate dishes for people to plate in the wished proportion.
