1.	Peel the onion, halve it and cut it into fine half rings. Mix themin a small bowl with the vinegar, sumac and ¼ tsp salt and set aside, covered. Shake occasionally until the onions are soft.
2.	Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise and quarter them. Scrape out the seeds with a tablespoon and discard. Cut them, slightly diagonally, into pieces about 2 cm thick. If you feel like a masterchef: Mix the pieces in a bowl with about ½ tsp salt and leave to steep in water for about 20 minutes. Stir frequently and discard the cucumber water at the end.
3.	Finely slice the radishes (can use a mandolin if we have one) and add to the cucumbers.
4.	Roughly chop the herbs and also add to the cucumber salad. 
5.	Wash the lemon in hot water and add about 1 tsp of lemon zest to the salad.
6.	For the dressing, grind the fresh garlic clove together with ½ tsp salt to a paste. Squeeze the lemon (approx. 2 tbsp), mix the juice with the garlic paste and then add the olive oil.
7.	Fold the dressing into the cucumber salad and add the soaked sumac onions.
Season everything with ground black pepper.
