Prepare the noodles as instructed. Basically:  place noodles in a bowl and cover with boiled water. Leave for 5-10 minutes (as instructed) until transparent and softened. Drain, rinse under cold water (for rapid cool and reduce stickiness) then detangle using your fingers. Drain thoroughly before use. Set aside to fully cool.
Prepare the vegetables: finely chop the purple onion and two types of cabbage.
Cut the carrot into thin strips (juliennes) using a sharp knife.
Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise and quarter them. Scrape out the seeds with a tablespoon and discard. Cut into thin strips.
Roughly chop the coriander leaves, and separate the mint leaves from the stems (do not chop, leave whole).
Prepare the sauce: grate the ginger and garlic and put in a jar or shaker.
Add all the other dressing ingredients and shake well.
Assemble the salad: in a large bowl put the glass noodles, all the vegetables and the sauce and mix well with your hands. Let the salad stand for about 10 minutes and mix again.
