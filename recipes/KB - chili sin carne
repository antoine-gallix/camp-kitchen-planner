# Instructions
1. Heat a large heavy-bottom fry-pan or pot over a medium heat. Heat the oil, then add
onion. Sauté for 10 minutes.
2. Add garlic, and sauté for a couple of minutes. Add carrots, sauté for another few minutes,
then add the red wine.
3. Around the fifteen minute mark, add cumin, smoked paprika, some salt and the bell
pepper. Turn up the heat to medium-high, until you hear the pan sizzling. Semi-fry the bell
peppers for a few minutes.
4. Turn down heat to medium and add tomato paste and another shot of salt. Sauté for a few
minutes, then add tinned tomatoes, beans, and corn. Add water into the tomato cans to rinse
them out, and pour in. If there is leftover broth powder, mix it in. Mix, then bring to the boil
and turn down the heat to a low simmer. Simmer uncovered for fifteen minutes.
5. Add in dark chocolate. Mix to melt in. Add in the lime juice, and mix.
6. Before adding the chilies, separate out a few ladles for the vanilla camp members. Once
their portion is safely out of the way, add the chili flakes and diced chipotle. Let simmer for
another 10 minutes.
7. Add in a good amount of grinds of the pepper shaker. Season to taste with salt.
Serve with nachos and bread.
