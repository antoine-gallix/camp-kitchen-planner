Heat canola oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add minced onion and cook until beginning to soften.
Mince and add ginger, garlic and cilantro stems and saut√© until tender, about 5 minutes. Watch out not to burn the garlic.
Stir in curry paste and cook 2 minutes. Slowly pour in coconut cream and milk, scraping up any curry paste with a wooden spoon.
Add tofu, cauliflower florets, mushrooms and tomatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 10 minutes until vegetables are just tender.
Add the spinach by the handful and stir after each addition until wilted.
Add lime juice and soy sauce to taste.
